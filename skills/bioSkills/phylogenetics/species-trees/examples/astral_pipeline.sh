# Coalescent species-tree pipeline: per-locus gene trees -> contract weak branches ->
# wASTRAL/ASTRAL species tree -> gene and site concordance factors.
# Deliverable: a species tree consistent under the MSC PLUS the gCF/sCF that show where
# the data actually agree -- not a single bootstrap number that hides the discordance.
#
# NOT SPOT-RUNNABLE without ASTER (astral/wastral) + IQ-TREE2 installed and real loci.
# All outputs are written under a namespaced OUTDIR the caller can delete; nothing in CWD.
