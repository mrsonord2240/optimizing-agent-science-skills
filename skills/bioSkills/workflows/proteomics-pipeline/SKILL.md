## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MSnbase 2.32.0, limma 3.62.2, MSstats 4.14.2, DEqMS 1.24.0, proDA 1.20.0, MSstatsTMT 2.14.2, arrow 23.0.1 (DIA-NN report.parquet), dplyr 1.2.1, tidyr 1.3.2, ggplot2 4.0.3 (checked 2026-09-15 on R 4.4.3)

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Proteomics Pipeline

**"Process my proteomics data from raw MS files to differential abundance"** -> Orchestrate data import (pyopenms/MaxQuant), QC assessment, protein quantification, normalization, differential abundance testing (limma/DEqMS, or MSstats for feature-level designs), and PTM analysis.

This is a workflow skill: it owns the chaining decisions and hand-offs, not the internals of any one step.

Scope: research cohort comparison. A pipeline output is not a diagnostic -- do not use it to triage, escalate or choose treatment for an individual patient; route those questions to validated clinical assays and the treating clinician.

## The governing principle

Bottom-up proteomics never measures proteins; it measures peptides and INFERS proteins, and the trustworthiness decisions are made at seams before the statistics.

1. **The search database + acquisition mode are committed once and inherited by everything.** The FASTA fixes the target-decoy frame (concatenated one-search FDR = #decoy/#target; a separate-search design needs mix-max instead — mixing the two mis-estimates FDR), what counts as a "unique peptide" (relative to the DB: canonical vs +isoforms), and the contaminants (cRAP must be IN the search DB from the start; a contaminant can BE the protein of interest, so never blind-delete `CON__` rows). DDA vs DIA is set at the instrument and dictates which imputation is even legitimate.
2. **FDR is re-controlled at THREE levels, not just PSM — and match-between-runs has its OWN FDR.** 1% PSM-FDR does NOT give 1% protein-FDR — each level (PSM, peptide, protein-group) needs its own target-decoy estimation; PSM-only filtering yields 10-30% real protein-FDR on deep data (one false PSM nucleates a false one-hit-wonder, and false proteins grow with dataset size). Use picked-protein/picked-group FDR. The two-peptide rule INCREASES protein-FDR, it does not reduce it. MBR transfers IDs across runs by RT/m-z and can be wrong for low-abundance precursors — do NOT report MBR-filled counts as directly measured; DIA-NN controls MBR-FDR via `Lib.*` q-values, IonQuant via an explicit MBR-FDR mixture model.
3. **Missingness is MODELED, not filled.** DDA missingness is structured left-censored MNAR; downshift imputation (mean=mu-1.8sigma) on an on/off protein inflates the t-numerator AND deflates the denominator (the volcano "wing" artifact). The honest report for a protein missing in one whole group is "undetected in group B", not a fold change — model the MNAR (proDA/msqrob2/MSstats-AFT).
4. **Normalize AFTER contaminant removal and AFTER inspecting raw distributions; batch is a covariate, not pre-subtracted.** Median-normalizing first mathematically erases a 3x-low load. Cross-plex TMT is invalid without an IRS bridge. `removeBatchEffect` before testing understates residual variance (anticonservative p) — put batch in the same model.

## Made-once commitments

| Commitment | Consequence inherited downstream |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Search FASTA + target-decoy strategy | The FDR estimator, what a "unique peptide" is, which contaminants exist; a mismatch mis-estimates FDR silently |
| Enzyme + fixed/variable mods (Carbamidomethyl-Cys fixed) | Which peptides exist to quantify; a fixed-mod misconfig loses all Cys peptides |
| DDA vs DIA acquisition mode | Missingness structure (MNAR vs ~MCAR), whether TMT is possible, which imputation is legitimate |
| FDR framing (PSM + peptide + protein-group, 1% each) | Real protein-FDR; PSM-only is 10-30% wrong on deep data |

## Complete R Workflow

**Goal:** Turn a MaxQuant or DIA-NN protein matrix into a table of differentially abundant proteins with honest missing-value handling.

**Approach:** Strip bookkeeping rows, log2 and inspect the RAW per-sample distributions (dropping failed loads before normalization can hide them), median-center, filter on per-group completeness, then test the OBSERVED values with moderated limma using treat() for a minimum fold change and batch as a covariate -- nothing is imputed. Upgrade to proDA when the dropout itself has to be modeled.

# NOTHING BELOW IMPUTES: limma fits each protein on its OBSERVED values, so the completeness
# filter above is the only missing-value handling in the executed path.

# --- DO NOT: left-censored downshift imputation, then limma ---
# Downshift MANUFACTURES systematic false positives for on/off proteins near the detection limit
# (the volcano "anchor arms"): it pins missing values ~1.8 SD below the mean with an artificially
# tight 0.3 SD spread, inflating the t-numerator and deflating its denominator. The honest report
# for a protein fully missing in one group is "undetected in group B", NOT a fold change. If a
# reviewer demands a complete matrix anyway, seed it (set.seed) so the call list is reproducible,
# and report the on/off proteins separately -- see proteomics/differential-abundance.

# === 5. QC ===
# PCA needs a complete matrix; use the proteins observed everywhere rather than inventing values.
# The complete-case set can be EMPTY -- 12 samples at realistic MNAR dropout is enough -- and
# prcomp then aborts the whole workflow at step 5 of 7 with `a dimension is zero`, which says
# nothing about missingness. Guard it, say what happened, and fall back to the pairwise-complete
# sample correlation, which answers the same clustering question without a complete matrix.
# QC is diagnostic: it must not gate the statistics below, and it is never a reason to impute.

## Workflow Variants

### TMT/iTRAQ Isobaric Labeling
Reporter extraction is a spectra-level step, not a text-matrix read. Within a single plex the channels are co-isolated/co-fragmented in the same MS2 event, so relative ratios are stable; but MULTI-batch TMT CANNOT be compared across plexes without an IRS bridge (a pooled reference channel in every plex; Plubell 2017). Route to proteomics/quantification for the mechanics.
```r

# Correct isobaric impurity cross-talk with the LOT-SPECIFIC matrix from the reagent CoA.
# makeImpuritiesMatrix(x = 10, edit = FALSE) returns a MANUFACTURER TEMPLATE, not an identity
# matrix -- its diagonal runs 0.928-0.965 and 5% of 126 lands in 127C. It is a shape check only;
# the numbers are lot-specific. (edit = TRUE, the default, opens an editor and blocks in scripts.)
# Do NOT use makeImpuritiesMatrix(filename = ...) for TMT10/TMTpro: it reads a CoA laid out by
# Da OFFSET and places each column k POSITIONS away in the reporter list, which is only correct
# for non-interleaved reagents (TMT6, iTRAQ). TMT10/TMTpro interleave N and C, so the +1 Da
# neighbour of 126 is 127C -- TWO positions away -- and the filename route silently writes the
# bleed into 127N instead. Build the matrix by CHANNEL NAME and hand it to purityCorrect:

impurities <- coa / 100                                  # CoA percentages -> fractions
tmt_data <- purityCorrect(tmt_data, impurities)
stopifnot(sum(exprs(tmt_data) < 0, na.rm = TRUE) == 0)   # negatives = a grossly wrong matrix (NOT a transposition test; see above)

# Multi-batch TMT: do NOT concatenate plexes directly. Use MSstatsTMT, which applies the
# reference-channel (IRS) bridge during summarization:
#   library(MSstatsTMT)
#   summ <- proteinSummarization(msstatstmt_input)   # includes the cross-plex bridge
#   groupComparisonTMT(summ, contrast.matrix = comparison)
```

### SILAC Workflow
Caveat: heavy-Arg -> heavy-Pro metabolic conversion biases ratios for proline-containing peptides (under-counts the heavy channel), and labeling efficiency must be checked (residual light reads as down-regulation). Route to proteomics/quantification for the mechanics.
```r
library(limma)

# SILAC ratios from MaxQuant (quote/comment.char as in the MSstats block above)
silac <- read.delim('proteinGroups.txt', quote = '', comment.char = '')
ratio_cols <- grep('Ratio.H.L.normalized', colnames(silac), value = TRUE)

# Log2 transform ratios. MaxQuant leaves NaN (and 0 for an absent channel) wherever it could not
# form a ratio, so log2 produces NaN/-Inf; coerce every non-finite cell to NA before testing.
silac_log2 <- log2(as.matrix(silac[, ratio_cols]))
silac_log2[!is.finite(silac_log2)] <- NA
rownames(silac_log2) <- silac$Majority.protein.IDs   # without this the result table has no identity

# Keep proteins with >= 2 finite ratios. apply(t.test) over the raw matrix STOPS the whole script
# with "not enough 'x' observations" on the first protein quantified in one replicate only.
keep <- rowSums(!is.na(silac_log2)) >= 2
cat('proteins tested:', sum(keep), 'of', nrow(silac_log2), '\n')

# One-sample moderated test against log2 ratio 0 (no change): an intercept-only limma fit borrows
# variance across proteins, which an unmoderated per-protein t-test at n = 3 cannot. Report the
# BH-adjusted p-value -- a raw p-value per protein controls nothing across thousands of tests.
fit <- eBayes(lmFit(silac_log2[keep, , drop = FALSE]), trend = TRUE, robust = TRUE)
results <- topTable(fit, coef = 1, number = Inf, adjust.method = 'BH')
# Proteins dropped by `keep` are an on/off presence table, not a fold change (quantification).
```

### DIA-NN Workflow
DIA-NN 1.9+ defaults to report.parquet (the only default in 2.0); read it with arrow, not read.delim. Filter on q-values BEFORE pivoting, or low-confidence rows enter the matrix. Route to proteomics/dia-analysis for the mechanics.
```r
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

diann <- read_parquet('report.parquet')

# Filter to 1% FDR at precursor AND protein-group level before pivoting.
# Use the GLOBAL protein-group q-value for the cross-run matrix (per-run min(Q.Value) is anti-conservative).
# When MBR is ON, MBR has its own FDR: add the Lib.* q-values (Lib.Q.Value, Lib.PG.Q.Value <= 0.01).
diann_filt <- diann %>%
    filter(Q.Value <= 0.01 & PG.Q.Value <= 0.01 & Global.PG.Q.Value <= 0.01)

# PG.MaxLFQ is ALREADY cross-run MaxLFQ-normalized at report generation. Re-normalizing it
# double-normalizes -- go straight to log2 + limma with no further normalization. To apply the
# skill's own median-centering instead, pivot raw PG.Quantity here, not PG.MaxLFQ.
protein_matrix <- diann_filt %>%
    select(Protein.Group, Run, PG.MaxLFQ) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Run, values_from = PG.MaxLFQ)

# PG.MaxLFQ path: log2-transform and go straight to limma (no re-normalization). DIA-NN writes 0
# for "not quantified in this run", so 0 -> NA FIRST: log2(0) is -Inf, and -Inf cells propagate
# silently until eBayes stops with "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed".
m <- as.matrix(protein_matrix[, -1])
rownames(m) <- protein_matrix$Protein.Group
m[m == 0] <- NA
log2_matrix <- log2(m)
stopifnot(!any(is.infinite(log2_matrix)))
```

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| ~1% PSM-FDR but 10-30% wrong proteins | FDR controlled only at PSM level | Estimate FDR at peptide AND protein-group level (picked-group FDR) |
| Volcano "wings" of huge-FC on/off proteins | Downshift imputation on MNAR (Perseus/MaxQuant) | Model the MNAR (proDA/msqrob2/MSstats-AFT); report "undetected in group B", not a fold change |
| Cross-plex TMT ratios differ 2-5x for no biology | Compared TMT across plexes without IRS | Pooled reference channel in EVERY plex + IRS bridge before comparison |
| A failed-load sample silently carried forward | Normalized before inspecting raw distributions | Filter contaminant/reverse rows -> inspect raw boxplots + ID counts -> remove failures -> THEN normalize |
| Anticonservative p-values | `removeBatchEffect` before testing | Put batch in the model (`~ batch + condition`); removeBatchEffect only for PCA |
| Every ratio subtly wrong | Wrong intensity column (`Intensity` vs `LFQ intensity` vs `iBAQ`) | Pick the right column; convert 0 -> NaN before log2 |
| Spurious DA that flips between conditions | Razor-peptide inference reassigns a shared peptide | Quantify at protein-group level or unique-peptides-only for sensitive comparisons |
| `EOF within quoted string`; far fewer rows than the file has lines | default `read.table` quoting on MaxQuant tables with apostrophes (`5'-nucleotidase`) and `#` | `read.table(..., quote = '', comment.char = '')`, then check `nrow` against `readLines` |
| `eBayes`/`lmFit`: `missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed` on a DIA-NN matrix | DIA-NN writes 0 for "not quantified"; `log2(0)` is `-Inf` | `m[m == 0] <- NA` before `log2`, then `stopifnot(!any(is.infinite(m)))` |
| `t.test`: `not enough 'x' observations` partway through a SILAC run | a protein quantified in one replicate only | filter to >= 2 finite ratios; moderated one-sample limma; report BH-adjusted p, never raw |
| Impurity correction makes adjacent TMT10 channels worse, not better | `makeImpuritiesMatrix(filename=)` places CoA Da-offsets by POSITION, but TMT10/TMTpro interleave N and C | build the matrix by channel name (rows = source reagent) and pass it straight to `purityCorrect` |
| A 3x-low injection sails through the raw-distribution check | the check read `LFQ intensity`, which MaxLFQ already renormalized, and used a 50%-of-median ID rule | inspect the raw `Intensity.` columns; flag a >= 1 log2 load shift or an ID count > 3 MADs below the median |
| `prcomp`: `a dimension is zero` at the QC step, before any statistics | no protein is observed in EVERY sample, so the complete-case matrix is empty (12 samples at realistic MNAR dropout is enough) | guard `nrow(complete) >= 3`; fall back to `cor(..., use = 'pairwise.complete.obs')`, lower `min_frac`, or drop the sparsest samples -- never impute to fill the PCA matrix |
| `makeContrasts`: `object 'Treatment' not found`, with a correct design matrix one line above | the contrast is hard-coded for two conditions; a dose series or time course has three or more | build the contrasts from `levels(sample_info$condition)` against the reference level, and adjust ACROSS them with `decideTests(method = 'global')` |
| Every unchanged protein drifts one way; the hit list is implausibly one-directional | median centering / `equalizeMedians` on a design whose changes are NOT symmetric (pulldown, secretome, strong one-sided response) | normalize on a set expected to be unchanged (spike-ins, `globalStandards`); check that the mean log2FC over expected-null proteins is ~0 |
| Impurity correction still leaves adjacent-channel bleed, no error, no negative values | the lot CoA was transposed -- same names, same shape, zero negatives, 2.7x worse than the right orientation | check orientation by row vs column sums to 100% before `purityCorrect`; rows are the SOURCE reagent |
