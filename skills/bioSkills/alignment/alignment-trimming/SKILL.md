## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: ClipKIT 2.14.0, trimAl 1.4.1, BMGE 1.12 and 2.0 (different flags, see below), MACSE 2.07, PAML 4.10.10, Divvier 1.01+, HMMcleaner (current CPAN release of `Bio::MUST::Apps::HmmCleaner`), BioPython 1.83+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: `clipkit --version`, `trimal --version`, `BMGE --help`, `Divvier --help`
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Alignment Trimming

**"Remove unreliable columns from this MSA"** -> Filter or split columns based on gap fraction, conservation, entropy, or per-residue quality.
- CLI: `clipkit`, `trimal`, `BMGE`, `Divvier`, `HMMcleaner`
- Python: post-process via Bio.AlignIO with custom column masks

**"Make this alignment publication-grade for phylogenetics"** -> Apply ClipKIT's `smart-gap` mode (its default), or trimAl `-automated1` for typical/exploratory publication use -- not for audit-grade reproducibility work, where the underlying mode must be named explicitly (see Reproducibility note under trimAl Modes) -- then verify via tree-stability comparison before vs after trimming.

Tool choice and aggressiveness matter more than trimming vs not-trimming. Pick a mode by dataset character (table below), and always run a sensitivity check by building trees on trimmed and untrimmed alignments.

### Pick a Trimming Mode by Dataset Character

| Dataset character | Trimming effect | Recommended approach |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Deep-divergence orthologs (>500 Ma), saturated 3rd codons | Aggressive trimming can hurt | No trim or light gap-based trim (`smart-gap`); report sensitivity to trimming choice |
| Mid-depth eukaryotic (animal phyla, fungal classes) | Light gap-based trimming usually neutral | ClipKIT `smart-gap`; confirm with trimmed vs untrimmed trees |
| Shallow (within-genus) | All trimmers ~equivalent | Choose for downstream-tool compatibility |
| Concatenated supermatrix with very long alignments (>10 kb) | Trimming removes gappy, poorly aligned regions | `smart-gap` or BMGE, run PER LOCUS before concatenation (trimming the concatenation invalidates partition charsets: IQ-TREE "Too large site ID") |
| Single short genes (<200 bp aligned) | Trimming amplifies stochastic error | Skip column trimming; use sequence-level outlier filtering |

**The 20%/40% rule (gap- and entropy-based trimming only).** Tan et al 2015 (Syst Biol) found that automated filtering frequently worsens single-gene trees. As an operational heuristic for modes that remove columns by gap content or entropy (ClipKIT `smart-gap`/`gappy`/`gappyout`, trimAl gap and similarity modes, BMGE, Gblocks): removing <20% of columns is light trimming; if the trimmer removes >40% (retention < 0.6), it is too aggressive for the dataset -- switch to a less aggressive setting or skip trimming. The heuristic does NOT apply to ClipKIT `kpic*`/`kpi*` modes: they drop every singleton column (`kpi*` also every constant column) by design, so they routinely remove 40-55% of a single gene. Judge those modes only by comparing topology AND branch lengths against the untrimmed alignment, never by column fraction.

Always run a sensitivity analysis: build the tree on trimmed AND untrimmed alignments. If topology and support are stable across trimming choices, the conclusion is robust; if unstable, report this and pick the result better supported by independent evidence (gene-tree concordance, biological priors).

## Goal-Driven Tool Selection

| Downstream goal | First-line tool | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Phylogenetic-tree input (concatenated genes) | ClipKIT `smart-gap`, per locus (Steenwyk et al 2020 PLOS Bio) | ClipKIT 2.14.0 default; removes only gappy columns, so branch lengths stay close to the untrimmed tree |
| Phylogenetic-tree input (single gene) | ClipKIT `smart-gap` | Default mode; dynamic gap-threshold determination |
| HMM profile building (HMMER, HHsuite) | trimAl `-gappyout` (Capella-Gutierrez et al 2009 Bioinf) | Aggressive gap removal acceptable; profile quality benefits |
| Selection / dN/dS analysis (PAML, HyPhy) | TCS column masking or GUIDANCE2 (NOT aggressive trimming) | Removing columns causes false-positive selection signals (Fletcher & Yang 2010 MBE) |
| Deep prokaryotic phylogenomics | BMGE (Criscuolo & Gribaldo 2010 BMC Evol Biol) | Substitution-matrix entropy (BLOSUM62 in 1.12, BLOSUM30 in 2.0); standard in GToTree pipeline |
| Cross-contaminated sequences | HMMcleaner (Di Franco et al 2019 BMC Evol Biol) | Per-residue cleaning; targets contamination not column quality |
| Preserve phylogenetic signal in indels | Divvier (Ali, Bogusz & Whelan 2019 MBE) | Splits ambiguous columns rather than removing them |
| Column-mapping retention for site analysis | trimAl `-colnumbering` | Outputs original-column indices for downstream cross-reference |
| Codon-aware trimming | MACSE `trimAlignment` (Ranwez et al 2018 MBE) | Preserves codon boundaries; pairs with MACSE codon MSA |

## ClipKIT Modes

Pick a `-m` mode by what the downstream task needs the alignment to KEEP. Run `clipkit --help` for the full list of 15 modes.

| Pick this mode | When |
|----------------|------|
| `smart-gap` | Default for single genes and supermatrices (ClipKIT's own default); keeps singleton and constant columns, so branch lengths are preserved |
| `kpic-smart-gap` | Topology-focused option for taxonomically balanced datasets only. Drops all singleton columns (typically 40-55% of a gene). Always compare outgroup/stem branch lengths before vs after; do not use when branch lengths feed dating, rate estimates or rooting |
| `gappy` / `gappyout` | Need an explicit gap threshold or trimAl-like behaviour |
| `kpi-smart-gap` / `kpi` | Parsimony-only input. Drops constant AND singleton columns, which inflates ML branch lengths; do not use for ML/Bayesian trees |
| `c3` / `cst` / `entropy` / `block-gappy` / `composition-bias` / `heterotachy` | Specialist needs: third-codon stripping, manual masks, entropy thresholding, conserved-block preservation, long-branch mitigation, or heterotachy filtering -- consult `clipkit --help` |

**Goal:** Run ClipKIT on an MSA with the mode appropriate to the downstream goal.

**Approach:** Pick a `-m` mode from the table above, optionally enable `--log` for reproducibility, and write the trimmed alignment in the desired format.

```bash
clipkit input.fasta -m smart-gap -o trimmed.fasta
clipkit input.fasta -m gappy -g 0.9 -o trimmed.fasta
clipkit input.fasta -m smart-gap -of phylip -o trimmed.phy
clipkit input.fasta -m smart-gap --log -o trimmed.fasta
```

The `--log` flag writes `<output>.log` with a per-column kept/removed record -- essential for reproducibility audits. ClipKIT also has a Python API (`clipkit.api.clipkit`) for in-memory trimming.

### ClipKIT kpic Failure Modes

`kpic` keeps parsimony-informative sites ("at least 2 sequences with each of at least 2 different residues") and constant sites, and removes singletons. On taxonomically unbalanced datasets (e.g. many close relatives + a few outgroups), a column where a single outgroup carries a private state is a singleton and is removed, so much of the outgroup-vs-ingroup signal is lost. In a simulated 30-strain + 3-outgroup DNA alignment, `kpic-smart-gap` removed most such columns: topology was unchanged, but the ingroup/outgroup stem length went from 0.44 to 1.2 substitutions/site (true 0.44) and one outgroup's terminal branch collapsed to 0. `smart-gap` left every branch length unchanged. Mitigations:
- Use `smart-gap` on unbalanced datasets and whenever branch lengths matter (dating, rates, rooting)
- If `kpic-smart-gap` is used, compare outgroup stem and terminal branch lengths before vs after trimming; if they move, discard the kpic result
- ClipKIT's site classification is count-based and unweighted (no sequence weighting by clade); manual subsampling to balance clades is the practical fix

BMGE's `-w` option is a sliding window for smoothing entropy values (default 3), not a clade-aware weighting.

## trimAl Modes

Pick a trimAl mode by downstream tool. `-gappyout` for HMM profile builds, `-gappyout` or explicit `-strict` for ML tree input (`-strictplus` is documented by trimAl as optimized for Neighbour Joining), `-automated1` (documented as optimized for ML) only when audit-grade reproducibility is not required (heuristic has changed across point releases).

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Automated heuristic | `-automated1` | Picks `gappyout`, `strict`, or `strictplus` based on alignment characteristics |
| Gap-only | `-gappyout` | Automatic gap-fraction threshold from gap distribution |
| Strict | `-strict` | Combined gap + similarity criterion |
| Strict-plus | `-strictplus` | Stricter than `-strict`; optimized for Neighbour Joining per trimAl help |
| Manual gap | `-gt 0.5` | Remove columns with > 50% gaps (set fraction explicitly) |
| Manual similarity | `-st 0.5` | Remove columns with similarity below threshold |
| Manual conservation | `-cons 60` | Keep at least 60% of original columns regardless of other criteria |
| Sequence-quality | `-resoverlap 0.8 -seqoverlap 75` | Remove sequences with poor residue/sequence overlap; thresholds are dataset-dependent -- see below |
| HTML report | `-htmlout report.html` | Visual diff of kept/removed columns |
| Column mapping | `-colnumbering` | Output original column indices preserved |

**Goal:** Trim an MSA with trimAl using a heuristic or manual threshold suited to the downstream tool.

**Approach:** Select an automated mode (`-automated1`, `-gappyout`, `-strict`; `-strictplus` for NJ) for typical use, or compose `-gt`, `-st`, `-cons` thresholds for manual control; export an HTML diff or column index mapping when audit-grade reproducibility is required.

```bash
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -automated1
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -gappyout
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -strictplus -htmlout report.html
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -gt 0.3 -st 0.5 -cons 60 -colnumbering > columns.txt
```

`-gappyout` is the recommended choice for HMM profile building (HMMER `hmmbuild` benefits from aggressive gap removal). For ML tree input use `-gappyout` or `-strict`; `-strictplus` is NJ-oriented and was the only trimAl mode that lost topological accuracy in a 10-replicate simulated check. `-automated1` is the fallback when characterising the dataset is impractical (it chose `-strict` and removed 61% of columns on one 15-sequence protein alignment -- check retention).

**Reproducibility note:** `trimAl -automated1` selects between `gappyout`, `strict`, and `strictplus` via internal heuristics that have changed between releases. For audit-grade reproducibility, do NOT use `-automated1`; specify the underlying mode explicitly and record `trimal --version` in pipeline manifests.

### trimAl Sequence-Overlap Filtering: Check What Was Removed

`-resoverlap`/`-seqoverlap` remove whole SEQUENCES, not columns: a sequence is kept only if at least `-seqoverlap` percent of its non-gap residues fall in columns whose overlap with the rest of the alignment reaches `-resoverlap`. This is meant to catch fragmentary or partial sequences, but `-resoverlap 0.8 -seqoverlap 75` (trimAl's own help-text example) is not a validated default -- on a real alignment it can also drop full-length, legitimate sequences if enough columns are gappy or divergent. Thresholds are dataset-dependent; treat them as a starting point, not a fixed recommendation. In a simulated 15-sequence protein alignment with two genuine partial contigs, `-resoverlap 0.8 -seqoverlap 75` removed 4 of 15 sequences, not 2: the two fragments plus two full-length sequences.

trimAl does not print which sequences it removed -- stdout only lists all-gap columns dropped afterward. Always diff the headers before vs after to see what actually left the alignment:

```bash
trimal -in input.fasta -out filtered.fasta -resoverlap 0.8 -seqoverlap 75
grep '^>' input.fasta | sort > in.txt
grep '^>' filtered.fasta | sort > out.txt
diff in.txt out.txt
```

If a removed sequence is full-length rather than a fragment you meant to drop, the threshold is too strict for this dataset: relax `-seqoverlap` and re-run the diff. On the same 15-sequence alignment, lowering `-seqoverlap` from 75 to 60 dropped only the two genuine fragments and kept both full-length sequences that 75 had discarded.

## BMGE: Block Mapping and Gathering with Entropy

Use BMGE for deep prokaryotic phylogenomics (the GToTree default) or whenever entropy-based, matrix-aware column filtering is preferred over gap-only heuristics.

**Goal:** Filter MSA columns by matrix-aware entropy and gap-rate thresholds, particularly for deep prokaryotic phylogenomics.

**Approach:** Invoke BMGE with `-t` (sequence type) and tune the entropy and gap-rate thresholds against the divergence depth of the dataset; recalibrate the entropy threshold if the substitution matrix is changed via `-m`. BMGE 1.12 and 2.0 use different flags: on 2.0, `-h` prints help and exits 0 without writing anything, so always check that the output file exists and is non-empty.

```bash
# BMGE 1.12
java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t AA  -h 0.5 -g 0.2 -of trimmed.fasta
java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t DNA -m DNAPAM100:2 -h 0.5 -g 0.2 -of trimmed.fasta

# BMGE 2.0 (entropy is -e; types AA|CO|NT; output -o or -of)
java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t AA -e 0.5 -g 0.2 -o trimmed.fasta
java -jar BMGE.jar -i input.fasta -t NT -m DNAPAM100:2 -e 0.5 -g 0.2 -o trimmed.fasta

test -s trimmed.fasta || echo "BMGE wrote no alignment: check flags against the installed version"
```

| Meaning | BMGE 1.12 | BMGE 2.0 |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Entropy threshold (lower = more aggressive) | `-h`, default 0.5 | `-e`, default 0.5 |
| Gap rate threshold | `-g`, default 0.2 | `-g`, default 0.5 |
| Substitution matrix | `-m`, default BLOSUM62 (AA) | `-m`, default BLOSUM30 (AA) / DNAPAM180:2 (NT) |
| Sequence type (required) | `-t AA`, `CODON`, `DNA` | `-t AA`, `CO`, `NT` |
| Minimum block size | `-b`, default 5 | `-b`, default 3 |
| Help | -- | `-h` |

Lower entropy thresholds trim much harder: on a simulated deep 16-taxon protein supermatrix, BMGE 1.12 `-h 0.4 -g 0.2` removed 87% of columns, shrank tree length from 12.5 (true) to 8.4 and lowered support, while `-h 0.5` removed 71%. Check retention against the 20%/40% rule and compare trees before lowering the threshold.

**Matrix-aware threshold:** BMGE computes entropy weighted by the chosen substitution-matrix probabilities. Entropy thresholds are calibrated for the version's default matrix (BLOSUM62 in 1.12, BLOSUM30 in 2.0). Switching to `-m BLOSUM30` (deep phylogenomics) makes the same numeric `-h` more permissive; `-m BLOSUM90` (close orthologs) makes it more aggressive. When using a non-default matrix, recalibrate by running on a known-good benchmark before applying.

## Divvier: Column Splitting Instead of Removal

Use Divvier when phylogenetic signal in indels matters and pure removal would discard block-boundary information; it splits ambiguous columns rather than dropping them.

```bash
# Divvier ships as a compiled binary; invoke as ./divvier or `divvier` if on PATH
./divvier -divvy input.fasta

./divvier -partial -mincol 4 -divvygap input.fasta
```

`-divvy` (default) outputs `input.fasta.divvy.fas` (full divvying); `-partial` only filters individual ambiguous characters. `-mincol N` sets the minimum number of confident characters required to keep a split column (integer count, default 2). `-divvygap` writes gaps instead of asterisks for phylogenetics-tool compatibility. Divvier is particularly useful when input alignments have many short conserved blocks separated by ambiguous regions -- removing the regions discards information about block boundaries that splitting preserves.

Maintenance note: Divvier's last release was 2019 (`simonwhelan/Divvier`); the tool is no longer actively maintained but results remain reproducible with the v2019 binary.

## Specialist Trimmers: HMMcleaner, Gblocks, PhyIN

Per-residue contamination cleaning (HMMcleaner), matching a legacy pipeline's defaults (Gblocks), and a phylogenetic-incompatibility second-pass after ClipKIT/trimAl/BMGE (PhyIN) come up less often than the tools above. See `references/specialist-trimmers.md` for their commands, flags, and applicability notes (HMMcleaner's >=15-sequence requirement, Gblocks' `-b1`/`-b2` sequence-count semantics, PhyIN's role as a second-pass tool).

## Decision Tree by Downstream Goal

```
What is the next step?
+- Phylogenetic ML tree (RAxML, IQ-TREE)
|  +- Concatenated supermatrix? -> ClipKIT smart-gap per locus, then concatenate
|  +- Single gene? -> ClipKIT smart-gap or trimAl -automated1 (not for audit-grade reproducibility -- see Reproducibility note)
|  +- Topology only, balanced taxa? -> kpic-smart-gap allowed, with the branch-length check
|  +- Deep prokaryotic? -> BMGE at its default entropy threshold; check retention
|  +- Suspected cross-contamination? -> HMMcleaner first, then ClipKIT
|
+- Bayesian inference (MrBayes, BEAST)
|  +- Same as ML; trimming is acceptable but log column mapping
|
+- HMM profile (HMMER hmmbuild, HHsuite)
|  +- trimAl -gappyout (aggressive gap removal helps profile quality)
|
+- Selection analysis (PAML codeml, HyPhy)
|  +- DO NOT aggressively trim
|  +- Use TCS column masking (T-Coffee -evaluate) or GUIDANCE2
|  +- See alignment/multiple-alignment confidence assessment
|
+- Sequence logo / motif scan
   +- Light gap-only trim (trimAl -gt 0.5)
   +- Preserve all variable positions
```

## Selection-Analysis Trimming: TCS and MACSE

Column masking before dN/dS analysis (TCS, via T-Coffee) and cleaning up MACSE's frameshift/stop markers for PAML or HyPhy input are both needed only when the downstream step is a selection analysis. See `references/selection-analysis-workflow.md` for the TCS masking commands, threshold guidance, and the MACSE `!`/`*` marker conversion recipes.

## Aggressiveness Cap

For gap- and entropy-based modes, compute the retained-column fraction and apply the 20%/40% rule above: warn if retention drops below 0.6 (more than 40% removed).

```python
def trimming_fraction(input_alignment, trimmed_alignment):
    return trimmed_alignment.get_alignment_length() / input_alignment.get_alignment_length()
```

If retention drops below 0.6, switch to a less aggressive setting or accept the original alignment unfiltered. For ClipKIT `kpic*`/`kpi*` modes the fraction is not informative (they remove singleton columns by design); compare the trimmed tree's topology and branch lengths with the untrimmed tree instead.

## Column Mapping for Reproducibility

When trimming for phylogenetic input, retain the column-index mapping so downstream site-specific analyses (selection per site, structure-mapped residues, etc.) can be back-traced:

```bash
trimal -in input.fasta -out trimmed.fasta -gappyout -colnumbering > kept_columns.txt

clipkit input.fasta -m smart-gap --log -o trimmed.fasta
```

These two flags emit different formats (checked on trimAl 1.4.1 and ClipKIT 2.14.0). `trimal -colnumbering` prints one line on stdout: `#ColumnsMap`, a tab, then a comma-separated list of the 0-based original column indices that survived (`#ColumnsMap	0, 1, 2, 4, ...`). `clipkit --log` writes `<output>.log` with one space-separated row per original column: 1-based position, `keep`/`trim`, site class (`constant`, `parsimony-informative`, `singleton`, `other`), gap fraction (e.g. `1 keep constant 0.0`). Parse both into the same 0-based kept-column list:

```python
kept_trimal = [int(x) for x in open('kept_columns.txt').read().split('\t', 1)[1].split(',')]
kept_clipkit = [int(row.split()[0]) - 1 for row in open('trimmed.fasta.log') if row.split()[1] == 'keep']
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ClipKIT empty output | All columns failed `kpic` filter | Switch to `smart-gap` mode (less aggressive); check input for non-amino-acid characters |
| trimAl "all sequences are identical" | Input has duplicates with no variation | Remove duplicate sequences first |
| BMGE Java OutOfMemoryError | Default JVM heap too small | `java -Xmx16g -jar BMGE.jar` |
| Divvier crashes on large input | Memory limits | Run on per-gene alignments rather than concatenated supermatrices |
| HMMcleaner reports "no contamination" | Input alignment too small (< 5 sequences) | Pool more sequences or skip per-residue cleaning |
| Trimming removes 80%+ of columns | Mode too aggressive for divergent input | Switch to `smart-gap`, raise the BMGE entropy threshold, or skip trimming (`kpic-gappy` is no less aggressive than `kpic-smart-gap`) |
| BMGE exits 0, prints usage, writes no file | BMGE 1.12 flags (`-h`, `-t DNA`) on BMGE 2.0 | Use `-e` and `-t NT`/`CO` on 2.0; check the output with `test -s` |
| IQ-TREE "Too large site ID" after trimming | Concatenated matrix trimmed; charsets still use untrimmed coordinates | Trim each locus, then concatenate and rebuild charsets |
| codeml "Error in sequence data file" on MACSE output | `!` frameshift characters left in the alignment | Replace `!` (sed, or MACSE `exportAlignment -codonForInternalFS ---`) |
