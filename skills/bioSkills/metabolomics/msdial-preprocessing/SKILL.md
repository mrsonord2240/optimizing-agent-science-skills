## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: MS-DIAL console 5.5.260820 (`MSDIALCUI.exe` -- confirmed installed and run on real data 2026-09-16), pandas 2.2+, R 4.3+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- CLI: run `MSDIALCUI.exe` (or `MSDIALCUI` on Linux/Mac) with no arguments to print the current subcommand/flag list, then `MSDIALCUI.exe <subcommand> --help` for that subcommand's real options
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters
- Python: `pip show pandas` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

The MS-DIAL GUI (`MSDIAL.exe`) runs only on Windows and hangs waiting for input if launched with `--help` or any unrecognized argument; the **separately-distributed** console app (`MSDIALCUI.exe`, packaged as its own `MSDIAL.console.*` release asset) is the cross-platform headless entry, and its real subcommand list -- confirmed by running it with no arguments -- is `gcms`, `lcms`, `lcimms`, `dims`, `imms`, `msn`, `eic`, `rtcorrection`, `imagegen`. GC-MS is real and working here: `gcms` is backed by its own `MsdialGcMsApi.dll` in the same release, so GC-EI does not require sourcing a separate MS-DIAL 4 build (see "Why GC-EI Is Different" below for what changed). If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed package and adapt rather than retrying.

# MS-DIAL Preprocessing

**"Process my LC-MS run with MS-DIAL and give me a feature table"** -> Pick peaks per file, deconvolve chimeric MS/MS into clean component spectra (MS2Dec), align across samples, gap-fill, then import the alignment result and filter it honestly.
- CLI: `MSDIALCUI.exe lcms -i <in> -o <out> -m <param.txt>` for LC-MS (DDA and DIA share this one subcommand -- see "Run MS-DIAL Headless" for how acquisition type is actually set); `MSDIALCUI.exe gcms -i <in> -o <out> -m <param.txt>` for GC-MS
- R: `read.csv(..., skip = 4, check.names = FALSE)` to parse the alignment export
- Python: `pandas.read_csv(..., skiprows=4)` for the same export

## The Single Most Important Insight -- Preprocessing Software Is Not Neutral

The same raw files through MS-DIAL versus XCMS yield different feature tables and different marker lists. Li 2018 benchmarked five tools on a 1,100-compound standard and found that while feature *detection* was broadly similar, *quantification* and the set of selected discriminating markers differed by tool. A metabolomics "hit" is conditional on (raw data + software + version + every parameter + fill/filter order), not on the raw files alone. MS-DIAL's specific differentiator is **MS2Dec deconvolution**: it reconstructs clean, library-matchable MS/MS spectra from chimeric DDA/DIA fragment data, which is what makes wide-window DIA (SWATH) tractable at all. Report the full processing specification as part of the result, and treat a finding that survives only one pipeline as a candidate, not a result.

## MS-DIAL vs XCMS

| Axis | MS-DIAL | XCMS |
|---|---|---|
| Interface | Windows GUI + cross-platform console | R package (scriptable everywhere) |
| Core differentiator | MS2Dec MS/MS deconvolution (DDA + DIA) | centWave peak picking, full programmatic control |
| Annotation | Built-in (library + MS-FINDER + LipidBlast) | Separate (CAMERA, downstream tools) |
| Lipidomics | Strong (predicted-CCS / EAD structural elucidation in v5) | Manual |
| Reproducibility unit | Param file + GUI choices | Versioned R script |
| Best when | DIA data, lipidomics, GUI workflow, built-in IDs | Scripted pipelines, custom parameters, cohort scale |

Use MS-DIAL when DIA deconvolution or built-in lipid annotation is the point; use metabolomics/xcms-preprocessing for fully scripted, version-pinned cohort processing. The strongest untargeted claims replicate across both.

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Situation | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| LC-MS, top-N MS/MS (DDA) | `MSDIALCUI.exe lcms` (folder input, or `acquisition_type=DDA` per file in a CSV `-i`) | Cleaner per-precursor MS2, but intensity-biased, stochastic coverage |
| LC-MS, wide-window MS/MS (DIA / SWATH) | `MSDIALCUI.exe lcms` (ABF input only; set `acquisition_type=DIA` per file in a CSV `-i`) | Complete MS2 coverage; chimeric spectra REQUIRE MS2Dec to be usable |
| GC-EI run | `MSDIALCUI.exe gcms`, or AMDIS/eRah | EI fragments every co-eluting compound; deconvolution IS detection (see below) |
| Headless / Linux cluster | `MSDIALCUI` (cross-platform console binary) with a `-m` param file | GUI is Windows-only; console is the reproducible batch path |
| Lipid-focused study | MS-DIAL + LipidBlast | -> metabolomics/lipidomics for lipid annotation mode |
| Already have an alignment CSV | skip processing, parse + filter | See import + honest-filter sections below |

## Why GC-EI Is Different

In GC-EI, 70 eV ionization fragments every compound reproducibly, so the trace at any retention time is a superposition of fragments from several co-eluting molecules. Naive peak picking conflates them; **deconvolution into component spectra IS the feature-detection step**, then each component is matched against EI+RI libraries (NIST, FiehnLib). Cross-run/cross-lab alignment uses **retention index** (Kovats n-alkanes, or Fiehn FAME markers giving diagnostic m/z 74/87) rather than raw RT, because RT drifts with column aging. GC-MS is supported directly by the current MS-DIAL 5.x console's `gcms` subcommand (confirmed real and working on 5.5.260820, backed by its own `MsdialGcMsApi.dll`) -- a separate MS-DIAL 4 build is not required.

## Run MS-DIAL Headless (console)

**Goal:** Process a folder of converted spectra into an alignment table without the GUI.

**Approach:** Pick the real subcommand (`lcms` or `gcms` -- there is no separate `lcmsdda`/`lcmsdia` token in the current console), point `-i`/`-o`/`-m` at input dir, output dir, and a method (parameter) file; keep `-p` only if the project should reopen in the GUI.

Verified 2026-09-16 against the real, installed `MSDIALCUI.exe` 5.5.260820: `MSDIALCUI.exe lcms -i <dir> -o <dir> -m <method.txt>` ran end to end on a real DDA mzML file and produced a real alignment export (see "Import the Alignment Result" below for its actual filename and column layout).

```bash
# LC-MS (DDA or DIA -- one subcommand covers both). Accepts netCDF/mzML/ABF for DDA;
# DIA/SWATH accepts ABF ONLY (convert vendor raw -> ABF first; MS2Dec is the point).
MSDIALCUI.exe lcms -i ./LCMS/ -o ./LCMS_out/ -m ./Msdial-lcms-Param.txt

# Acquisition type (DDA vs DIA) is not a console token -- it is set per file. For a
# single-mode batch, a plain input folder is enough (every file processed the same
# way, as above). To mix modes or set it explicitly, pass -i a CSV instead of a folder,
# with one row per raw file and an `acquisition_type` column (DDA or DIA), per the
# official MS-DIAL 5 console tutorial (systemsomicslab.github.io/msdial5tutorial):
#   file_path,file_name,file_type,class_id,acquisition_type,batch_order,analytical_order,factor
#   LCMS/sample1.mzML,sample1,Sample,A,DDA,1,1,1
MSDIALCUI.exe lcms -i ./filelist.csv -o ./LCMS_out/ -m ./Msdial-lcms-Param.txt

# GC-EI: retention-index alignment, quant-mass quantification. Real and working in
# the current 5.x console (see "Why GC-EI Is Different" above) -- no MS-DIAL 4 needed.
MSDIALCUI.exe gcms -i ./GCMS/ -o ./GCMS_out/ -m ./Msdial-GCMS-Param.txt -p
```

The parameter (`-m`) file is plain text with **`Key: Value`** pairs (colon-separated, one per line, `#` for comments) -- not `Key=Value`. The `Minimum peak height` key is the direct analog of an intensity floor and is instrument-dependent: the GUI default is tuned for a TOF and is often far too high (or its baseline assumption wrong) for an Orbitrap. Set the alignment reference to a pooled QC, never to file #1 by default.

## Import the Alignment Result into R

**Goal:** Split the MS-DIAL alignment export into a feature-metadata frame and an intensity matrix.

**Approach:** The export carries four header rows above the real column header (sample class / file type / injection order / batch), so skip them. Verified 2026-09-16 against a real `MSDIALCUI.exe` 5.5.260820 run: the file is **not** named `AlignResult.txt` -- the console writes `AlignResult-<timestamp>.mdalign` (still a plain tab-separated text file, plus sibling `.mzTab` and `.qa.tsv` exports of the same run); glob for `AlignResult-*.mdalign` rather than assuming the literal name. Metadata columns precede the per-sample intensity columns, but real exports interleave extra annotation/QC columns (Formula, Ontology, INCHIKEY, SMILES, matched-flag and dot-product-score columns, spectra text, ...) between the last *known* metadata column and the real sample columns -- taking "everything after the last known metadata column" pulls those text columns into what should be a numeric matrix. Anchor on the header block instead: MS-DIAL writes each of the 4 header rows as one row-label cell (`Class`, `File type`, `Injection order`, `Batch ID`) immediately followed by one value cell per sample, so the column right after the `Class` cell in row 1 is where the real sample columns start.

```r
# MS-DIAL alignment export: real column header is on row 5, so skip the first 4 rows.
# Filename is timestamped -- Sys.glob() instead of a literal name.
export_file <- Sys.glob('AlignResult-*.mdalign')[1]
msdial <- read.csv(export_file, sep = '\t', skip = 4, check.names = FALSE)

# Metadata columns appear before the per-sample intensity columns. Common ones:
# 'Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name', 'Adduct type',
# 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Reference RT', 'Formula', 'Ontology', 'INCHIKEY',
# 'SMILES', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)'.
meta_cols <- c('Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name',
               'Adduct type', 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)')
meta_cols <- intersect(meta_cols, colnames(msdial))

# Sample columns start right after the header block's "Class" label cell -- NOT
# simply "everything after the last known metadata column" (real exports interleave
# unlisted annotation/QC columns before the real per-sample data; see above).
header_row1 <- as.character(read.table(export_file, sep = '\t', header = FALSE, nrows = 1,
                                        check.names = FALSE, colClasses = 'character',
                                        comment.char = '')[1, ])
class_idx <- which(header_row1 == 'Class')
sample_cols <- colnames(msdial)[(class_idx + 1):ncol(msdial)]

feature_info <- msdial[, meta_cols]
intensity <- as.matrix(msdial[, sample_cols])
rownames(intensity) <- msdial[['Alignment ID']]
storage.mode(intensity) <- 'numeric'  # confirms every detected sample col is truly numeric
```

## Import the Alignment Result into Python

**Goal:** Same split, in pandas.

**Approach:** `skiprows=4` to land on the real header; locate the sample columns via the same `Class`-cell anchor as the R path above, not by position after the last known metadata column.

```python
import csv
import pandas as pd
import glob

export_file = glob.glob('AlignResult-*.mdalign')[0]  # timestamped filename, not a literal AlignResult.txt

with open(export_file, newline='') as f:
    header_row1 = next(csv.reader(f, delimiter='\t'))
class_idx = header_row1.index('Class')

msdial = pd.read_csv(export_file, sep='\t', skiprows=4)
meta_cols = ['Alignment ID', 'Average Rt(min)', 'Average Mz', 'Metabolite name', 'Adduct type', 'Fill %', 'MS/MS assigned', 'Annotation tag (VS1.0)']
meta_cols = [c for c in meta_cols if c in msdial.columns]
sample_cols = msdial.columns[class_idx + 1:]  # everything after the "Class" cell, not after the last known metadata column

feature_info = msdial[meta_cols].copy()
intensity = msdial[sample_cols].astype(float).copy()
intensity.index = msdial['Alignment ID']
```

## Filter the Table Honestly

**Goal:** Keep features supported by real signal and known confidence, without overtrusting annotation tags.

**Approach:** Filter on Fill% (cross-sample presence), require MS/MS support for any feature called identified, and tie the annotation tag to a real MSI confidence level rather than treating a name as proof.

```r
# Fill% is the fraction of samples with a DETECTED (not gap-filled) peak. Low Fill% means
# the feature exists mostly as gap-filled noise-floor integrals, which fabricate intensity
# (an honest 'below detection' becomes a positive number). 70% is a common floor -- but
# MS-DIAL 5.x's real "Fill %" column is a 0-1 FRACTION (e.g. 1.00 = 100%), not 0-100
# (confirmed on a real MSDIALCUI.exe 5.5.260820 run, 2026-09-16), so compare to 0.70:
keep_fill <- feature_info[['Fill %']] >= 0.70

# An annotated name without MS/MS is at best an MSI Level 2/3 putative ID (accurate mass
# only). Require MS/MS support before trusting any identity downstream. MS-DIAL 5.x's real
# value is title-case text ("True"/"False"), not "TRUE"/"FALSE" -- an exact-case comparison
# silently keeps zero features on real output, so compare case-insensitively:
has_msms <- tolower(trimws(feature_info[['MS/MS assigned']])) == 'true'

# Annotation tag confidence (do NOT treat a name as an identification). The exact tag
# vocabulary is MS-DIAL-version-dependent, so inspect unique(feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']])
# and map the strings the build actually emits rather than hard-coding them:
#   Metabolite / Lipid  with MS/MS  -> MSI Level 2 (spectral library match)
#   Suggested*          mass-only   -> MSI Level 3 (putative, no MS/MS)
#   Unknown                         -> unannotated feature
feature_info$msi_level <- ifelse(feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']] %in% c('Metabolite', 'Lipid') & has_msms, 2,
                          ifelse(grepl('^Suggested', feature_info[['Annotation tag (VS1.0)']]), 3, NA))

filtered <- intensity[keep_fill, ]
```

**Python:** the same `MS/MS assigned` check needs a different guard, not just a different case. `pandas.read_csv` auto-casts a text column of literal `True`/`False` (or `TRUE`/`FALSE`) to native `bool` with no warning, so the R idiom's natural Python port (`== 'True'`) silently evaluates to all-`False` -- confirmed 2026-09-16 (0/94 real MS/MS-supported features flagged when ported naively). Force the comparison to be dtype-safe:

```python
keep_fill = feature_info['Fill %'] >= 0.70  # same 0-1 fraction as the R path
has_msms = feature_info['MS/MS assigned'].astype(str).str.strip().str.lower() == 'true'
```

Confidence-level honesty and orthogonal-evidence identification belong to metabolomics/metabolite-annotation; this skill only routes the tag to the right level. Fill% / blank / drift filtering interacts with normalization-qc - process blanks and pooled QCs through the SAME run, then filter the aligned table.

## Per-Method Failure Modes

### DIA processed as DDA (wrong acquisition type)
- **Trigger:** Running SWATH/DIA data through `lcms` without ever setting DIA acquisition type.
- **Mechanism:** Without DIA acquisition type set (per file, via a CSV `-i` with an `acquisition_type` column -- see "Run MS-DIAL Headless"), MS-DIAL does not deconvolve wide-isolation chimeric MS/MS, so fragments from co-isolated precursors stay mixed.
- **Symptom:** Library matches to the wrong compound; "clean-looking" spectra that fail orthogonal confirmation.
- **Fix:** Pass `-i` a CSV with `acquisition_type=DIA` for those files (ABF input only); MS2Dec deconvolution is the entire reason to run DIA in MS-DIAL.

### Over-trusting the annotation tag
- **Trigger:** Filtering on `Annotation tag != Unknown` and calling the survivors "identified."
- **Mechanism:** A `Suggested*` tag is an accurate-mass guess with no MS/MS; a named hit without MS/MS is MSI Level 3.
- **Symptom:** A marker list full of confident-sounding names that do not validate against standards.
- **Fix:** Require MS/MS support for any identity claim (case-insensitive check -- MS-DIAL 5.x's real value is `True`/`False`, not `TRUE`/`FALSE`); map tags to MSI levels (see filtering section) and defer to metabolomics/metabolite-annotation.

### Gap-fill masquerading as measurement
- **Trigger:** Treating low-Fill% features as quantitative.
- **Mechanism:** Gap-filling integrates whatever signal sits in the m/z-RT box even when no peak exists, turning a true below-detection (MNAR, left-censored) value into a positive number.
- **Symptom:** "Significant" features that are mostly gap-filled in one group; shrunken fold-changes for on/off markers.
- **Fix:** Report per-feature filled fraction; gate on Fill% >= 0.70 (MS-DIAL 5.x reports it as a 0-1 fraction, not 0-100 -- see filtering section); for inferential stats prefer MNAR-aware imputation over naive fill (see metabolomics/normalization-qc).

### GC-EI run through an LC pipeline
- **Trigger:** Treating GC-EI data like LC peak-pick-then-group, or assuming MS-DIAL 5 has no GC mode.
- **Mechanism:** EI needs component deconvolution, not adduct-style peak picking, and RI (not RT) alignment; the current MS-DIAL 5.x console's `gcms` subcommand does handle this (confirmed real and working on 5.5.260820) if a plain LC-style `lcms` run is used instead.
- **Symptom:** Conflated co-eluting compounds and cross-lab RT misalignment.
- **Fix:** Use `MSDIALCUI.exe gcms` (or AMDIS/eRah); align on Kovats/FAME retention index.

## Quantitative Thresholds

| Threshold | Source | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Fill% >= 70% (0.70 on MS-DIAL 5.x's real 0-1 Fill % scale) | Common untargeted practice | Below this, the feature is mostly gap-filled noise-floor integrals, not measurements |
| QC CV (RSD) < 20-30% | Broadhurst 2018 | Technical reproducibility floor; drop features noisier than this in pooled QCs |
| D-ratio (sd_QC/sd_sample) < 0.5 | Broadhurst 2018 | Keeps features whose technical variance is well below biological variance |
| Blank filter: sample mean > 3-5x blank mean | Broadhurst 2018 | Removes background/contaminant features present in process blanks |
| ~10x more features than compounds | Mahieu 2017 | One metabolite makes adducts/isotopes/fragments; counting features over-counts hypotheses |

## Common Errors

| Error / symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| `MsdialConsoleApp lcmsdda`/`lcmsdia` not found | That naming is from the older pre-5.x console; current builds ship `MSDIALCUI.exe` with one `lcms` subcommand | Run `MSDIALCUI.exe` with no args to print the real subcommand list; use `lcms` for both DDA and DIA |
| All columns land in one field on import | Header offset wrong; tab-separated export read as CSV | `skip=4` (R) / `skiprows=4` (Python), set `sep='\t'` |
| `Fill %` filter keeps 0 features, or keeps everything | Comparing a 0-1 fraction (MS-DIAL 5.x's real scale) against a 70-100 threshold | Compare against 0.70, not 70 |
| `MS/MS assigned` filter always evaluates False | Real value is title-case `True`/`False` text (Python: pandas may also silently cast it to native `bool`), not `TRUE`/`FALSE` | Compare case-insensitively: `tolower(trimws(x)) == 'true'` (R) / `x.astype(str).str.strip().str.lower() == 'true'` (Python) |
| DIA input rejects mzML | DIA mode accepts ABF only | Convert vendor raw to ABF (Reifycs ABF converter) before setting `acquisition_type=DIA` |
| `Annotation tag` column not found | Header changes across versions (e.g. `Annotation tag (VS1.0)`) | Match by prefix / inspect `colnames()`; do not hard-code the suffix |
| Console command not found on Linux | Expecting the GUI executable | The GUI (`MSDIAL.exe`) is Windows-only and hangs on unrecognized args; run the separately-packaged `MSDIALCUI` console binary (cross-platform) |
| Few features detected | `Minimum peak height` default too high for the instrument | Lower it toward the real baseline; defaults are TOF-tuned |

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Need fully scripted, version-pinned R processing with custom peak-picking parameters -> metabolomics/xcms-preprocessing.
- The data is already lipid-annotated or the question is lipid-class/species-level -> metabolomics/lipidomics.
- The question is about confidence-level honesty or orthogonal-evidence identification for a feature you already have -> metabolomics/metabolite-annotation.
- The question is drift correction, QC-CV/D-ratio filtering, blank filtering, or MNAR-aware imputation on an already-aligned table -> metabolomics/normalization-qc (this skill only routes the Fill%/MS-MS/annotation-tag columns to the right level; it does not implement those filters).
