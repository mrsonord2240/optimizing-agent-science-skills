name: optimize-scientific-skills
description: Coordinate a batched relay of up to five concurrent workers that pre-screens, normalizes scientific agent Skills, prepares their tooling, audits and repairs them, independently certifies them, and runs local Marketplace intake. Use when Sam asks to process or resume the science-Skill backlog, run audit-fix-reaudit work, or close a refinement batch.

# Optimize Scientific Skills

Coordinate the relay; delegate each phase to its focused worker Skill. A run is
complete only when exact committed Skill bytes pass independent executable
re-audit and the Open Science Skill Marketplace's local intake validator.

## Load contracts progressively

Read only the contract needed for the next decision:

- Before claiming or mutating work, read the
  [repository contract](references/repository-contract.md) and
  [relay operations](references/relay-operations.md).
- Before the first dispatch or phase transition, read the
  [phase handoff contract](references/phase-handoff.md).
- Before interpreting audit readiness, reusing evidence, or publishing records,
  read [readiness and records](references/readiness-and-records.md).
- Read the [Marketplace intake gate](references/marketplace-intake-gate.md) only
  when a candidate-ready batch is about to close.

Do not preload later-phase contracts or worker Skill bodies merely because a run
has started.

The worker Skills are independently distributable. Their bodies include their
own phase safety and completion rules; do not replace those rules with a large
orchestrator prompt.

## Route phases

Use the following worker Skills by exact name:

| Phase | Worker Skill | Transition evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Normalize | `normalize-scientific-skill` | normalized tree identity and surface inventory |
| Tool | `prepare-scientific-skill-tooling` | `TOOLS.md` and environment fingerprint |
| Initial audit | `audit-scientific-skill` | diagnostic report and finding ledger |
| Fix | `fix-scientific-skill` | finding dispositions and tooling impact |
| Final re-audit | `reaudit-scientific-skill` | candidate-ready decision for exact bytes |
| Delta re-audit | `reaudit-scientific-skill`, delta mode | candidate-ready decision for text-only changes to certified bytes |

Worker-contract delivery is part of dispatch. Resolve the selected worker
Skill's actual `SKILL.md` as a sibling of this orchestrator Skill and include
that absolute path in the worker brief. Set the worker's model explicitly from
the model table in [relay operations](references/relay-operations.md); the
default is Sonnet, never Haiku. The worker's first action must be to
read the complete file successfully. Merely naming the Skill is insufficient:
a fresh agent may start from a repository that does not expose the orchestrator's
Skill registry. If the contract cannot be read, the worker must report that
blocker and stop without searching other repositories for a substitute role or
improvising the phase.

Dispatch a fresh agent for every phase. A worker owns one phase for the Skills
assigned to it under the batching table in relay operations (one Skill unless
that table allows a batch), then retires after writing each Skill's canonical
handoff. The orchestrator must not
invoke a worker Skill in its own context or perform worker-phase tasks. It may
only select and claim work, dispatch the exact worker Skill, validate the
handoff and evidence, update lane state, and close accepted batches.

## Run the relay

### 1. Establish the batch

Treat the invocation as the primary selector and resolve targets progressively:

- **Explicit Skill target:** use only the named Skill or Skills. Do not inspect
  the backlog, index, aggregate status, or the full corpus to select work. Read
  an active handoff when present, query only the matching corpus entry and
  per-Skill records, then verify its provider metadata and live Git state.
- **Resume request:** start from active handoffs and live claims. Read only the
  records linked by those handoffs. Do not select replacement Skills unless the
  invocation permits refilling lanes.
- **No target supplied:** parse `audits/CORPUS.json` locally and emit only the
  fields needed to identify a bounded eligible shortlist, normally `id`,
  `upstream_path`, `category`, and `state`. Stop once there are enough verified
  candidates to fill the permitted lanes plus a small reserve for conflicts.
  Do not print or load the complete corpus into model context.

#### Automatic-selection gate

An automatically selected Skill must have substantive unfinished refinement
work. Before dispatching any worker, verify the corpus state, latest applicable
audit, optimized-shelf presence, active handoff, and open finding severity for
that Skill. Record the eligibility reason in the lane table.

Exclude a Skill from default selection when any of these is true:

- its corpus state is `candidate-ready`, `ready`, `done`, or `out-of-scope`;
- the latest audit applies to the current bytes and marks them deployable or
  `Production Ready` with no unresolved required recommendation;
- the exact audited bytes are already present on the optimized shelf;
- only Marketplace, publication, release, or other separately authorized work
  remains; or
- another lane or live worker already owns it.

Do not choose an almost-finished or ready Skill merely to exercise the relay,
and never restart normalization on exact bytes that already passed final audit.
If corpus, audit, and shelf state disagree, park selection of that Skill and
record a targeted records-reconciliation item; do not treat the disagreement as
permission to redo the product work.

For automatic selection, rank eligible work in this order:

1. an in-scope open P0 or hard readiness blocker;
2. `untouched` or `remaining` work with no usable audit for the current source;
3. `audited` work with a required fix or re-audit still incomplete;
4. lower-priority backlog refinement only when the invocation requests backlog
   or polish work, or after the user explicitly permits that tier.

For a fresh process pilot, choose from the first eligible Skill that genuinely
requires the full relay, normally an `untouched` or `remaining` Skill without a
current final audit. If no candidate passes the gate, report that there is no
eligible default work; do not weaken the gate. An explicit user target may
override automatic-selection exclusion, but run only its earliest incomplete or
specifically requested phase rather than replaying completed phases.

Use **query, don't dump** for generated records. Begin with an exact Skill ID,
path, state, or heading query; read a bounded matching object or section; expand
only when the unanswered selection or transition question requires it. Never
read all of `audits/CORPUS.json`, `audits/INDEX.md`, `audits/BACKLOG.md`,
`audits/STATUS.md`, or `audits/STATUS.html` as a startup inventory.

- Use `CORPUS.json` for canonical inventory, category, source path, and state,
  but filter it programmatically without emitting unrelated entries.
- Use per-Skill record JSON and the active handoff for exact audit identity,
  findings, phase, ownership, and transition evidence.
- Read `BACKLOG.md` only when the user asked for backlog work, the selected
  Skill's open recommendation must be resolved, or targeted canonical records
  cannot settle priority. Search exact Skill IDs or headings first and read only
  that bounded section. Expand to adjacent ranked entries only as needed to fill
  an allowed lane; do not read the full backlog by default.
- Read `INDEX.md` only for a needed human-facing link or a targeted
  record-consistency check. Read `STATUS.md` or `STATUS.html` only for an
  aggregate status request or dashboard verification. Loading one generated
  view is not a reason to load its siblings.

A full generated-file read is permitted only when the user explicitly requests
a whole-report review or a generator/schema defect cannot be diagnosed with
targeted queries. State that reason before expanding scope.

Inspect live agents and claims and relevant Git status for the resolved targets.
Select only in-scope or canonically next-eligible Skills. Record exact source
identity and the earliest incomplete phase. Claim at most ten Skills and run at
most five concurrent workers, and honor any lower invocation-level lane,
worker, or Skill limit as a hard run boundary. Do not refill beyond a stated
batch-size limit.

#### Pre-screen before any agent

Before claiming, run the mechanical preflight on every shortlisted source
directory from the records repository root:

```powershell
git -C marketplace\intake\openscience-skill-marketplace fetch origin
python tools/skill_preflight.py <source-skill-dir> [...]
```

- A `fail` for an ID collision (already in the live Marketplace catalog,
  differing from one only by `bio-`, or already in the Marketplace review
  queue) excludes the Skill: record the reason in the lane table and do not
  dispatch any phase for it.
- A `warn` for a near-duplicate name goes into the Skill's handoff for the
  normalizer and auditor to judge semantic overlap; it does not exclude.
- Hygiene, category, and author failures on upstream sources are expected;
  normalization must clear them.

Maintainers judge inclusion; they check duplicates, license scope,
attribution, and whether claims hold. Spend nothing on a Skill the pre-screen
already disqualifies.

### 2. Normalize every Skill

Run `normalize-scientific-skill` before tooling or behavioral audit. Accept a
normalize handoff only when `tools/skill_preflight.py` reports `PASS` for the
normalized tree and its identity equals the handoff's, and its frontmatter
`description` is a single `Use when <task or situation>.` trigger with no tool
lists, coverage summaries, or pointers to other Skills. Check that line
yourself at transition and reject a handoff that kept the long form. A Skill
already certified with a long description takes the one-line edit, with the
exact old and new strings recorded in `edits.json` in its fix run directory,
then a delta re-audit. A prior
audit is reusable only when it applies to the exact normalized candidate bytes,
uses the current report schema, and retains its evidence. A structural
change normally makes an older audit diagnostic history rather than the active
audit.

### 3. Prepare tooling

Run a full `prepare-scientific-skill-tooling` pass after normalization, unless
an existing `TOOLS.md` covers the exact runnable-surface inventory and its
recorded environment fingerprint is verified live. Tooling must be ready
before an initial audit or, when a usable initial audit is reused, before a fix.
Batch tooling by ecosystem so shared environments and public inputs are built
once, and reuse what earlier runs already staged, under the shared staging
rules in relay operations. Do not tool heavy optional surfaces (defined in the tooling worker
Skill); they stay labelled as not executed in the Skill.

### 4. Audit, fix, and certify

Run one comprehensive but bounded `audit-scientific-skill` pass when no usable
initial audit exists. Its minimum dynamic scope is the common workflow end to
end, a second materially distinct workflow when applicable, and one inspected
example of each materially different output family within reason. Dispatch
`fix-scientific-skill` for open findings, known P0s, readiness blockers, wrong
outputs, and safely bounded lower-priority defects. A truly clean diagnostic
audit may proceed directly to final re-audit.

After every fix, inspect its tooling impact:

- `none`: reuse the verified environment;
- `changed`: run a tooling-delta pass for affected surfaces;
- `uncertain`: treat as changed until a tooling worker resolves it.

Then dispatch a fresh independent `reaudit-scientific-skill` worker. The final
pass retests corrected findings and affected regressions, confirms a canonical
core smoke, and reuses identity-matched immutable evidence for untouched
surfaces. A failure returns to a fresh fixer for one focused repair loop, then
any required tooling delta, then a fresh re-auditor. Restart broad audit only
when the failure affects shared architecture, invalidates the environment or
evidence identity, or materially changes the advertised workflow set. A
user-action blocker may be parked without occupying a worker slot once its
exact state is durable.

The initial auditor, delta re-auditor, and final re-auditor each publish their
own record and regenerate the views as soon as their report is final, so a
crash cannot lose a finished audit. At transition the orchestrator verifies the
publication and commits the records repository. Keep rejected intermediate runs
as durable local evidence and publish them only when needed to preserve a
blocker, explain a candidate-identity transition, or satisfy the records
schema. Keep each freed lane filled while eligible work remains.

The readiness gate is the target, not a score. Once a Skill is
`candidate-ready`, do not dispatch fix work only to raise its score. Open P2s
after that are handled only in the cheap path: one text-only fix worker for up
to ten candidate-ready Skills, then delta re-auditors (up to three Skills each)
under the re-audit worker's delta mode. A P2 that needs runnable-byte changes
or new execution waits for a later refinement run unless it makes output wrong.

### 5. Stage candidate-ready Skills

Copy or promote each exact candidate-ready tree to
`F:\optimized-scientific-skills\skills\<skill-id>` with only the provider and
provenance metadata needed to identify it. Verify byte identity with
`tools/skill_preflight.py --offline` on both the working tree and the staged
shelf copy: both must report `PASS` and the identity of the accepted final or
delta audit. Exclude every in-progress or blocked Skill and all unrelated
changes.

### 6. Close the run

Treat one invocation as one product batch:

1. Create one unpublished optimized-shelf commit containing all and only this
   run's candidate-ready Skills and required shared metadata.
2. Immediately after every commit, amendment, or replacement commit that
   changes a Skill or its provider metadata in `optimized-scientific-skills`,
   run `npm run audits:inventory` from the records repository, followed by
   `npm run audits:check`. The inventory command refreshes
   `audits/CORPUS.json` from the optimized shelf and regenerates all four audit
   views. A plain `npm run audits:index` is not a substitute because it reuses
   the saved corpus snapshot. Do not treat the product commit as reconciled
   until both commands pass.
3. Run the Marketplace's local intake gate against that full commit.
4. Resolve failures according to the gate. A Skill-byte change returns through
   fix and fresh re-audit; a manifest-only change does not.
5. Exclude unresolved Skills and amend or recreate the unpublished commit.
   Repeat the mandatory post-commit inventory refresh and rerun intake whenever
   the product commit changes. Stop only when intake has accepted the exact
   final commit and final product history contains one run-closing optimized
   commit.
6. Once the optimized-shelf commit and its provenance rows are final, run
   `python tools/export_bioskills.py --apply --push` from the records
   repository. It copies every finished bio-derived Skill's exact committed
   bytes to its `upstream_path` in the `F:\OpenScience\bioSkills-Improved`
   checkout as one commit and pushes it; Sam authorized this push on
   2026-09-30. The run is not closed until a plain `python
   tools/export_bioskills.py` reports `to export: 0`.
7. Commit resumable state for unfinished lanes in the records repository when
   useful; never put unfinished Skills in a product batch.

Apart from the step 6 fork push, do not push, open pull requests, build
Marketplace bundles, add reviewer identity, submit, register, release, publish,
or mutate other remote state without separate authorization.

## Report the run

Report completed, blocked, and in-progress Skills; final phase and readiness;
audit, provider, and handoff paths; product commit hashes or why absent;
Marketplace intake receipts; user-action items; and confirmation that no
unauthorized remote or publication action occurred.
