# proteome acquires the opposite offset. Measured on a set with 44 up vs 26 down among 296
# proteins: every true null moved -0.19 log2 (t vs 0, p = 2e-55) and 21 of 179 true nulls were
# called at BH 5%, all negative. Normalize on a set expected to be unchanged (spike-in standards,
# an internal-reference protein set, or the housekeeping bulk) when the design is one-sided,
# and always check the null centre afterwards -- see the Common Errors row.

# Missingness in label-free DDA is left-censored MNAR (missing BECAUSE low). The modern,
# correct approach is to MODEL the missingness in the likelihood, NOT impute it. See
# proteomics/differential-abundance for the decision (proDA / msqrob2 / MSstats-AFT).
# NOTHING BELOW IMPUTES: limma fits each protein on its OBSERVED values, so the completeness
# filter above is the only missing-value handling in the executed path.

# --- UPGRADE: model the dropout explicitly with proDA, then use `da` in place of `results` ---
# library(proDA)
# fit <- proDA(as.matrix(filtered), design = ~ condition, col_data = sample_info,
#              reference_level = 'Control')            # add batch: design = ~ batch + condition
# da <- test_diff(fit, contrast = 'conditionTreatment')   # columns: diff (log2FC), pval, adj_pval

# --- DO NOT: left-censored downshift imputation, then limma ---
# Downshift MANUFACTURES systematic false positives for on/off proteins near the detection limit
# (the volcano "anchor arms"): it pins missing values ~1.8 SD below the mean with an artificially
# tight 0.3 SD spread, inflating the t-numerator and deflating its denominator. The honest report
# for a protein fully missing in one group is "undetected in group B", NOT a fold change. If a
# reviewer demands a complete matrix anyway, seed it (set.seed) so the call list is reproducible,
# and report the on/off proteins separately -- see proteomics/differential-abundance.

# === 5. QC ===
# PCA needs a complete matrix; use the proteins observed everywhere rather than inventing values.
# The complete-case set can be EMPTY -- 12 samples at realistic MNAR dropout is enough -- and
# prcomp then aborts the whole workflow at step 5 of 7 with `a dimension is zero`, which says
# nothing about missingness. Guard it, say what happened, and fall back to the pairwise-complete
# sample correlation, which answers the same clustering question without a complete matrix.
# QC is diagnostic: it must not gate the statistics below, and it is never a reason to impute.
